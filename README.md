# Boosting and Bagging GUI Tool

This project is a GUI-based tool for implementing and comparing Bagging and Boosting ensemble techniques in machine learning. It allows users to upload datasets, preprocess them, and evaluate the performance of Bagging and Boosting models using scikit-learn.

## Features
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with Tkinter for easy navigation.
- **Dataset Upload:** Supports CSV files.
- **Ensemble Techniques:** Implements Bagging and Boosting using Decision Trees.
- **Performance Metrics:** Provides accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix visualization.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `os`
- `tkinter`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install missing libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
